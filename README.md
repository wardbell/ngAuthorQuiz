#Angular Author Quiz

This is a translation to Angular of Liam McLennan's 
[React Fundamentals](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-fundamentals)
PluralSight sample app.

It serves as reference for a comparison of react and angular programming styles. As such, I tried to be faithful to the original react source while still illustrating common Angular patterns and practices.

You can [see and run the Angular Author Quiz in plunker](http://embed.plnkr.co/YBRxdPDUCwiZ0u5ByMgS/preview).

The comparison and discussion are in the [github repo wiki](https://github.com/wardbell/ngAuthorQuiz/wiki/Comparing-Author-Quiz-angular-and-react-versions).
